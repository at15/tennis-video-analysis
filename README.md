python3 -m venv playground
source playground/bin/activate
pip install opencv-python
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Install ffmpeg for `moviepy`

```bash

pip install pygame
``` 

Use qt? maybe use PyQt6 instead of PyQt5... https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt6-actions-toolbars-menus/

```bash
brew install qt # this is qt6
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76113859/unable-to-install-pyqt5-on-macos
brew install qt5
```

Convert video

```bash
ffmpeg -i test_serve.mov -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k test_serve.mp4
```

## Known issues

- most code are generated by copilot :doge:
- only tested on macOS arm64
- moviepy cannot render portrait video correctly, see [issue](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/issues/586) and the future of moviepy is uncertain see [issue](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/issues/1874)
